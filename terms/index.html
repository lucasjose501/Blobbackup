    <p>Please read this before using BlobBackup products.</p>

<p>This is a legal agreement between you as an individual and BlobBackup, LLC. ("BlobBackup”), and governs the terms and conditions of your use of BlobBackup Products (as defined below) and any updates that may be provided. This Agreement, along with any written documentation expressly incorporated herein by reference and published from time to time by BlobBackup (collectively, the "Agreement"), constitutes the entire agreement between BlobBackup and you regarding BlobBackup Products, and supersedes all prior agreements between the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement.</p>

<h1>Definition of Terms</h1>

<p>BlobBackup, LLC. is referred to herein as "BlobBackup," "we," "us," or "our."
You, as the user, are referred to herein as "you," "user," or "customer."
BlobBackup software (whether preinstalled, on a medium, or offered by download), BlobBackup services, BlobBackup websites (including, without limitation, www.blobbackup.com) and all other software, features, tools, websites, documentation and services provided by BlobBackup, LLC. are referred to herein as “BlobBackup Products”, “Products”, “Software” or “Services”.
Access, installation, usage, and/or registration of BlobBackup Products are referred to herein as “use” or “usage”.</p>

<p>To Use BlobBackup Products You Must Agree to these Terms of Service.</p>

<p>By using a BlobBackup Product, you agree to these terms and conditions ("Terms of Service"), the BlobBackup Privacy Policy, and the Payments and Refunds. If you are using the Service in an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms of Service on behalf of that organization. Each time you use a BlobBackup Product, you reaffirm your acceptance of the then-current Terms of Service. If you do not wish to be bound by these Terms of Service, you may discontinue using the BlobBackup Products. You cannot use BlobBackup Products until you have accepted these Terms of Service. You represent and warrant that you have adequate legal capacity to enter into binding agreements such as these Terms of Service.</p>

<h1>Acceptable Use</h1>

<p>You are solely responsible for your conduct and your data related to the Service. The Products are made available to you only for your personal use, which use must be in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and must not infringe or violate third party rights. The Service may be used in a business or other organization. You may not make commercial use of the Software or Service, including but not limited to selling or distributing the Software and/or Service to any third party.</p>

<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless BlobBackup, its vendors, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of the BlobBackup Products.</p>

<h1>Product License</h1>

<p>BlobBackup and its vendors grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable limited license to install the Products distributed by BlobBackup in object code form only on any computer or device from which you wish to access the BlobBackup service for the sole and exclusive purpose of using the BlobBackup Products in accordance with these Terms of Service.</p>

<p>You agree to install and use a paid subscription to any of the BlobBackup Products on only one device at a time. If you wish to protect multiple devices, each requires a separate paid subscription.</p>

<h1>Restrictions on Use of Products</h1>

<p>You may access BlobBackup Products only through the interfaces and protocols provided or authorized by BlobBackup. You agree that you will not access BlobBackup Products through unauthorized means. You may not obtain the communications protocol for accessing the BlobBackup service, the BlobBackup Products, or any other BlobBackup services. BlobBackup may offer Products that limit the time, type of files, storage space, or other features. You agree not to attempt to circumvent these limitations in any way.</p>

<h1>Equipment</h1>

<h1>User Accounts and Passwords</h1>

<p>You are responsible for keeping your password secure. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your user name. If you lose your password for your account, you may not be able to access your Data.</p>

<h1>Changes to the Service</h1>

<p>BlobBackup occasionally will provide automatic upgrades to improve your BlobBackup experience, although these upgrades may not be consistent across all platforms and devices. You agree to take no action to interfere with such automatic upgrades, scanning, and related services. BlobBackup has the right at any time to change, modify, add to or discontinue or retire any aspect or feature of the BlobBackup Products including, but not limited to, the software, hours of availability, equipment needed for access or use, the maximum disk space that will be allotted on BlobBackup servers on your behalf, or the availability of BlobBackup Products on any particular device or communications service. BlobBackup has no obligation to provide you with notice of any such changes.</p>

<h1>Fair Use</h1>

<p>BlobBackup reserves the right to terminate or suspend accounts of users who violate these Terms of Service or who BlobBackup deems, in its sole discretion, to be “abusers.” Such users may be notified prior to suspension or termination of their accounts; however, BlobBackup is not required to provide prior notice. Any failure by BlobBackup to enforce this policy will not preclude us from enforcing it at anytime in the future, whether for past or current violations.</p>

<h1>Data Collection and Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>BlobBackup Products may require you to register and provide certain personal information to BlobBackup, such as name, e-mail address, date of birth, zip code (the "Personal Information"). If you register for any BlobBackup Product, you agree to provide accurate and complete Personal Information and you agree to keep such information current.</p>

<p>The BlobBackup Privacy Policy describes how BlobBackup collects and uses Personal Information. You consent to BlobBackup’s use of your Personal Information under the terms of the BlobBackup Privacy Policy available at www.blobbackup.com/privacy.</p>
